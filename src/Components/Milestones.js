        <p>Our academy has a rich and inspiring history that traces back to its humble beginnings. In 1990, G. Ranganath and Kamala Nayana Ranganath 
        founded a small dancing 'Kalayathanaya' in Warakapola. Their dedication and passion for the art of dance quickly made the Kalayathanaya a cherished 
        institution within the community, fostering a love for traditional dance among countless students. <br/><br/>As time passed and circumstances changed, the 
        Kalayathanaya in Warakapola was eventually closed, leading the Ranganath family to relocate to Colombo. This move marked a new chapter in their 
        journey. The vibrant cultural scene in Colombo provided fresh opportunities and a broader audience for their artistic endeavors.<br/><br/>After a few years 
        of establishing themselves in Colombo, Ishani Yahodha Ranganath, the daughter of G. Ranganath and Kamala Nayana Ranganath, carried forward the family’s 
        legacy. With her exceptional talent and vision, she founded the 'Ranga Dance Academy'. Ishani's profound understanding of both traditional and contemporary 
        dance, combined with her innovative approach to teaching, quickly elevated the academy's reputation.<br/><br/>The Ranga Dance Academy became a beacon of excellence 
        in the dance community. Under Ishani's leadership, the academy not only preserved the rich cultural heritage of traditional dance but also embraced modern 
        techniques and styles. The academy offered a diverse range of programs, catering to students of all ages and skill levels, and became known for its high 
        standards of training and performance.<br/><br/>Ishani’s commitment to excellence and her ability to inspire her students led to numerous accolades and recognition f
        or the academy. The Ranga Dance Academy produced many accomplished dancers who went on to achieve great success in their careers, both nationally and internationally.
        <br/><br/>Today, the Ranga Dance Academy continues to thrive, honoring the legacy of G. Ranganath , Kamala Nayana Ranganath and Ishani Yahodha while evolving with the times. 
        It remains a place where the art of dance is celebrated, taught, and cherished, ensuring that the passion for dance is passed down to future generations.</p>
